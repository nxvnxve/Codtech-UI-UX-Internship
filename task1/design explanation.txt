Task 1 – Website Landing Page Redesign

📌 Task Description:
Redesign the landing page of an existing website of your choice. Focus on improving the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). Make it modern, minimal, and responsive.

📦 Deliverables Asked:
- Before and After screenshots of the design
- Explanation of the design decisions made
- Figma file or image mockups

🌐 Website Chosen:
OceanofPDF – a free ebook download platform

🎯 Reason for Choosing:
The original OceanofPDF homepage had several UX and UI flaws including a cluttered layout, lack of content hierarchy, no clear search or navigation aid, and an overall outdated appearance. It provided a good opportunity to demonstrate a complete homepage redesign that focuses on clarity, usability, and visual appeal.

✅ Design Solutions Implemented:
- Introduced a structured, grid-based layout to organize content clearly
- Added a large, visible search bar in the hero section for direct access to book search
- Created a Featured Categories section with icons to guide browsing
- Designed uniform book cards with title, author, and download CTA
- Used consistent spacing and modern typography for improved readability
- Replaced the plain footer with a 4-column layout including About, Support, Legal, and Social links
- Ensured the overall design was clean, minimal, and responsive

📈 Result:
The redesigned homepage offers improved clarity, visual balance, and ease of navigation. Users can now search, browse, and explore more efficiently — with a layout that adapts to all screen sizes.
